## Payoff Formulas at Expiry

- **Call option payoff**:
$$
\max(S_T - K, 0)
$$
- **Put option payoff**:
$$
\max(K - S_T, 0)
$$
where $ S_T $ is the asset price at expiry.

## Profit and Loss

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Payoff} - \text{Premium}
$$

- You pay the premium **upfront**.
- Payoff is realized at expiry (or when exercised).

## Additional Concepts

- **Underlying asset**: The stock, commodity, index, etc. the option is based on.

- **In the Money (ITM)**: When exercising the option would be profitable (e.g., $ S_T > K $ for calls).

- **Out of the Money (OTM)**: When exercising would result in no profit (e.g., $ S_T \leq K $ for calls).

- **At the Money (ATM)**: When the asset price is approximately equal to the strike price.

- **Protective Put**: Owning the underlying asset and buying a put to limit downside risk.

- **Trading options**: You can buy and sell options contracts without exercising, to lock in profits or hedge.
